# gantry-2axis-object-detector
This project is a real-time 2-axis gantry object detector and tracker that combines YOLOv8 computer vision with Arduino-controlled stepper motors. Using a camera feed, the Python script detects objects, calculates their coordinates, and sends precise movement commands to the gantry system over serial communication. 

I have attached the dataset that i have used for my project below( that is the best.pt file)
